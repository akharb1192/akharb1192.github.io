## About Me

Hello! I am Ankit!

Currently, I am a student at **_Vellore Institute of Technology_** where I am currently pursuing Master of Computer Applications. I am actively working on Hackerrank and LeetCode problems and i am very much interested in coding , especially problem solving through Java and Python. 

I graduated from [University of Delhi](https://www.du.ac.in/) with Bachelor in Computer Science. My fields of interest are Machine Learning,Java,Python and Cloud computing. 

I worked on research projects at Vellore Institute of Technology under the supervision of [Prof.SenthilKumar N]
on Movie Success Prediction using Data Mining. My Capstone (thesis) was focused on Motion Picture recommendation analysis using Content and Collaborative filtering. Please download my [resume](https://github.com/akharb1192/akharb1192.github.io/blob/master/ankitgit.pdf) here.



I am an enthusiastic person and always curious to learn. I strongly believe in collaboration. I love to attend conferences to learn, grow in my career and have attended conferences
